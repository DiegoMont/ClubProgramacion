/*
A frog is currently at the point 0 on a coordinate axis Ox. It jumps by the following algorithm: the first jump is a units to the right, the second jump is b units to the left, the third jump is a units to the right, the fourth jump is b units to the left, and so on.
Formally:
  * if the frog has jumped an even number of times (before the current jump), it jumps from its current position x to position x+a;
  * otherwise it jumps from its current position x to position xâˆ’b.
Your task is to calculate the position of the frog after k jumps.
But... One more thing. You are watching t different frogs so you have to answer t independent queries.
INPUT
The first line of the input contains one integer t(1 <= t <= 1000) - the number of queries
Each of the next t lines containe queries (one per line).
The query is described as three space-separated integers a, b, k(1 <= a, b, k <= 10^9) - the lengths of two types of jumps and the number of jumps, respectively.
OUTPUT
Print t integers. The i-th integer should be the answer for the i-th query.
