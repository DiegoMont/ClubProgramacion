/* CONSECUTIVE SUM RIDDLE
Theofanis has a riddle for you and if you manage to solve it, he will give you a Cypriot snack halloumi for free (Cypriot cheese).
You are given an integer n. You need to find two integers l and r such that -10^18 <= l < r <= 10^18 and l+(l+1)+...+(r-1)+r=n.
INPUT
The first line contains a single integer t(1 <= t <= 10^4) â€” the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^18).
OUPUT
For each test case, print the two integers l and r such that -10^18 <= l < r <=10^18 and l+(l+1)+...+(r-1)+r=n.
